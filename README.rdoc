== README

Bookopotamus is my final project for a Ruby on Rails certification course. It is a Rails 4 app using Ruby 2.0.0-p353.

To get this app running:

* Download

* bundle install

* edit the appropriate config files

* rake db:migrate and rake db:seed

* start up the server

I highly recommend using Pow! http://pow.cx

In order to actually deliver the necessary emails, you will want to set up a cron job to run the rake tasks in admin.rake.

This project had a list of 25 requirements. I documented them as milestones for GitHub issues. You can find them here: https://github.com/ilynne/bookopotamus/milestones. I completed 22 of 25. Number 16 is partially completed -- users can *ask* to receive a digest.
